# Task Tracker

## Overview
The Task Tracker is a simple web-based application that helps users stay organized by adding, editing, deleting, and sorting their daily tasks. This project is developed as part of the CS361 Software Engineering I course.

## Product Goal
The goal is to build a reliable, usable, and fast Task Tracker that allows users to manage tasks, mark them complete, and sort them by due date or priority.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Add new tasks with titles and descriptions.
- Edit and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Sort tasks by due date or priority.
- User login and logout for secure access.
- Tasks saved so they persist across sessions.

## Quality Attributes
- **Usability:** Simple and clear user interface.
- **Reliability:** Tasks are saved correctly and not lost.
- **Performance:** Tasks can be added, updated, or sorted quickly.

## Sprint 1 Plan
- Set up GitHub repository and Project board.
- Add Product Backlog user stories to Project board.
- Implement core features: Add task, login, and sorting.
- Test core functionality.


This project will be improved in future sprints with more features and refinements.
